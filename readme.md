# Typescript Cheatsheet

Project with a cheatsheet for the programming language Typescript. To run,
clone this repository

    git clone https://github.com/yds12/ts-cheatsheet.git

then `cd` into it and, with **Node.js** and **npm** installed, run:

    npm install

This command will install the packages `typescript` (the Typescript compiler)
and `ts-node` (a REPL for Typescript).

Now you can try to compile the `.ts` file with:

    npx tsc index.ts

It will generate a `index.js` file in the same directory. All the interesting
stuff is, however, written as code and comments in the `index.ts` file.
